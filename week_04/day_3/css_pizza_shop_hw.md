#CSS and HTML

## MVP

To recap what we did today, go trough this wonderful learning resource / game

- https://flukeout.github.io/

Test if you understood all the CSS referencing tricks from flukeout by styling your pizza shop.

Try to complete these without using any classes. If impossible use as little classes as possible (basically)

- give delete button some red margins
- make pizza name have a larger font and text should be bold
- pizza list items should have interchangeable a background color. Say odd orders orange, even orders yellow.
- make all the text in the top-most pizza gray (to indicate that it is being processing)

Mini Extension:
- put each pizza in a div and give that div a class that says what type it is eg. `class="pizza margarita"`
- Is there a way to group pizzas (using a grey border) of the same type that appear one after another? (so that the cooks have an easier job preparing many of the same pizzas). [hint: this is hard / impossible]

## Extensions

To prepare for tomorrow, have a look at these resources about flexbox:

- css tricks flex https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Have a go at completing this layout game (at least first 5-10 levels):

## Further Extensions

You can try to apply a flex box styling to your pizza shop. But remember to git commit it somewhere before, because you will likely break it.

Read over the code from today and see if you can follow it through.
