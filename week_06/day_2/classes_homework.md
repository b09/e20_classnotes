# Homework

Create your own Library class with an internal collection of Books.

## MVP

* Write a method to count the number of Books in the Library.
* Write a method to add a Book to the Library stock.
* Add a capacity to the Library and write a method to check if stock is full before adding a Book.  

## Extensions:
* Add a third class which interacts with the other two. E.g. you could add a `Borrower` with a method that takes a `Book` and moves to the `Borrower`'s collection.
* Add an Enum for the genre of books. (e.g. thriller, crime, etc.) with a string value of a short description of the genre.

## Advanced Extension
* The library wants to keep track of it's number of books by genre. Using a HashMap, store the Genre of each book as the key - and a count of how many books of that genre as the value.
